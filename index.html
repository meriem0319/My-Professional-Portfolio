                    <p>I am new to Web Development, and I am currently taking a FullStack Bootcamp to learn more about this domain. For the past 14 years I have been a Patent Application Editor as a sub-contractor with the USPTO. I have watched our development department create and enhance different apps that we use in order to edit all patent applications and get them from a culmination of paperwork to a US published patent. I want to be part of that development department and enhance the apps even more. Since I have hands on experience working with multiple systems to edit an application, I can assist in many projects that have failed testing because the developers do not have that hands on experience on the production floor like I do. I have participated in many focus group projects to make the necessary corrections and push apps and train the employees on how to use the new additions to make their process much easier and more efficient.</p>
