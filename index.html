            <p>
              I am new to Web Development, and I am currently taking a FullStack
              Bootcamp to learn more about this domain. For the past 14 years I
              have been a Patent Application Editor as a sub-contractor with the
              USPTO. I have watched our development department create and
              enhance different apps that we use in order to edit all patent
              applications and get them from a culmination of paperwork to a US
              published patent. I want to be part of that development department
              and enhance the apps even more. Since I have hands on experience
              working with multiple systems to edit an application, I can assist
              in many projects that have failed testing because the developers
              do not have that hands on experience on the production floor like
              I do. I have participated in many focus group projects to make the
              necessary corrections and push apps and train the employees on how
              to use the new additions to make their process much easier and
              more efficient.

              This application is targeted to make a Pre-School teacher's life
              easier! It provides a platform to keep a list of students' names,
              their parent's contact information and important notes about the
              student. A teacher is also able to update, view or delete a
              student's record.

              This application is designed to help parents and caregivers of
              younger Autistic children create routine To-Do Lists, log
              important information in a Notes tab, share and connect with other
              parents and caregivers by creating posts. In this project we will
              build and design this app using the React, create our own
              server-side API, add user authentication, and connect to a
              database.
